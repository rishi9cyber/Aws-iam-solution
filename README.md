# IAM Solution for Cloud (AWS)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** in **AWS**. It includes examples of creating IAM roles, policies, and managing access control for cloud resources.

## Key Features
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Define roles and policies to control access to AWS resources.
- **Access Management**: Manage user and role permissions securely.
- **Integration with AWS Services**: Use IAM to secure services like S3, EC2, and Lambda.

## Use Cases
- Enterprise environments requiring secure access to AWS resources.
- Organizations looking to enforce least privilege access.
- Compliance with security standards like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS IAM**: For managing roles, policies, and permissions.
- **AWS CLI**: For automating IAM tasks.
- **JSON**: For defining IAM policies.

## How It Works
1. IAM roles and policies are defined using JSON.
2. Users and applications are assigned roles with specific permissions.
3. Access to AWS resources is controlled based on these roles and policies.

## Code Examples

### IAM Policy (JSON)
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
